## PhoneBook

This project is a full stack MERN app where users can register into the App and manage(create,read, edit and delete) their contacts. They can later come and login into the app and can see their contacts.  
The frontend of the app will be built with React framework and currently I have only made the Backend API of the app with NodeJS and Express to handle requests and using MongoDB as database.I also implemented authentication in app using JWT.
