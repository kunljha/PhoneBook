## PhoneBook - [Live Demo](https://lit-cove-09524.herokuapp.com)

This project is a Full Stack **MERN** app where users can register into the App and manage(create, read, update and delete) their contacts. They can later come back and login into the app and can see their saved contacts.  
The frontend of this webapp is built with **React** and the backend server is built using the NodeJS framework **Express**.  
I have used **MongoDB** as the Database and also implemented authentication using **JWT**.
